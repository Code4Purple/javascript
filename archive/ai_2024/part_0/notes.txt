What is reinforcement Learning?

The Agent (the ai) performs actions within the environment and based on it actions within the environment 
we can set a State of Reward(Good Job Reward or Bad Job Reward) for it to learn. 

The Bellman Equation

Concepts:
    S - State
    A - Action
    R - Reward
    Y - Discount

 Equation :  V(s) =  max(R(s,a)+yV(s'))
