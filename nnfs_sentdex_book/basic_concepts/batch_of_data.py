# Batch of Data 

''' To train neural network we tend to receive data in batches. 
Each of thsese values is a feature obseration datum and together they form
a feature set instance , also called an oberservation, or most commonly, a sample.'''

'''An example of a batch can be :
    Input Data :                      Shape : 
        batch = [[1, 5, 6, 2],          (8, 4)
                 [3, 2, 1, 3],
                 [5, 2, 1, 2],
                 [6, 4, 8, 4],
                 [2, 8, 5, 3],
                 [1, 1, 9, 4],
                 [6, 6, 0, 4],        Type :
                 [8, 7, 6, 4]]          2D array, Matrix
