Why didn't nerual netoworks never caught on in the 1994?
    Processing power and data was not up to speed to to train models of nerual netoworks.
    Ai was ahead of the processing access back in the 1994.



Comparsion of storage: 

1956
    The massive hardware to store maybe 5mb if you are lucky.

1980 
    Store was a size of a whole pc now, and only got to at that point 10mb

Now 
    The Store is so small and fast the smallest value size carded is a 256GB over the 10mb before hand

Moores Law is why the storage and computers are becoming cheeper over time . This includes processing power as well.

What is Deep Learning ?

Geoffrey Hinton :
    * Grandfather of Deep Learning *
    Deep Learning is the idea is for computers to become on of the best tools for learning which is our brain.
    
    The idea behind the ai :
        Build a artical zone full of nodes and 3 main node layers are input and ouput layers are easy to understand.
        But the hidden layer the infinite processing that the tasks are understood and processed for an output.


The Neuron
    Basic building of artical nerual netoworks.
